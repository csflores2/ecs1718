    <h2><b>Education:</b></h2>
    <p><b>The first school that I attended was Cardinal Bernerdin Early Childhood Center (CBECC). CBECC is a Catholic Montessori School offering Preschool through Third Grade. I attended CBECC when I was 4 years old and graduated when I was 9. This school was an amazing experience because I was able to grow up in an environment where everyone worked and collaborated with each other. The teachers and mentors taught me how to work well with other people and most importantly how to be grateful and appreciate everything I have in my life.</b></p>

    <p><br><b>The second school that I attended was James G. Blaine Elementary School. Blaine is  Chicago Public School and they teach kids from Preschool to Eighth Grade. Blaine has three core values that they teach to all students: 1) Unity Through Teamwork, 2) Safety Through Respect, and 3) Achievement Through Effort. I attended Blaine in the fourth grade and graduated in eigth grade. Blaine and CBECC are completely different environments. The teaching styles were different, the rules were different and even the kids who attended the schools were different. Coming from a Montessori school to a CPS school was a big change for me. However, being able to mature at Blaine and grow as a person and as a student has helped me a lot with the transition from Elementary School to High School.</b></p>

    <p><br><b>The current school that I attend is Lane Tech College Prep. This is my first year at this high school and it has been a huge change. My high school offers many academic, athletic, and social opportunities for students to prepare for college. On my first day at Lane, I was a complete nervous wreck. I was intimidated by my fellow class mates, the size of the school, the teachers, and most importantly the academics. But after a month or so, I began to get comfortable with the people and the enviornment of Lane. Lane Tech was my first choice when ranking the Selective Enrollment high schools I was to apply to. I am beyond grateful that I got into Lane Tech, and that I am representing this school.</b></p>

    <h4><br><b>Academics:</b></h4>
    <p><b>Ever since I was a little girl, I was always thriving to learn. Learning new things has always been a part of who I am. My dad always told me that Education and Learning starts at home. Before I attended my first school, my parents taught me how to read, how to do basic mathematics and how to play instruments like the guitar and piano. Later on I started to learn different languages, Spanish, French, and Japanese. Back then I thought that it was unnecessary to learn all of that, but now I know that all of that learning has helped me tremendously with my schoolwork. I know how to focus, how to take good notes, and how to study for quizzes or tests. Math has always been my strongest subject because to me it was always fairly easy to understand and apply rules and formulas. Till this day, math is my favorite subject and I see myself succeeding later on in my career with my knowledge of mathematics.</b></p>
    <h5><br><b>Accomplishments:</b></h5>
    <p><b>I have accomplished many things for only being 14 years old. Many of them involve activities outside of school. I am fluent in Spanish and almost fluent in French as well. When I was around 7 years old, my dad made me read books about finance and investing. Ever since then, I have had a knowledge about making money and how to be successful when it comes to making and managing money. Later on in middle school, I got more involved in dancing and martial arts. I did Judo, Jiu-Jitsu, Boxing, and Muay Tai. In dance, I did Ballet, Jazz, Lyrical, tap, Hip-Hop, and Acrobatics. Last year I advanced to Pointe in ballet and I still dance till this day. This year I started to gain more interest in fitness and health. Since my dad is a very good coach and knows a lot about fitness and living in a healthy manner, he currently coaches me in fitness and trains me with sports and other activies so that I maintain a healthy life style.</b></p>
