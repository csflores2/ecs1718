<p><b>Ever since I was little, I had a passion for dancing. Dancing has always been a hobbie that I enjoyed to do and was always interested in. I have done pretty much every form of dance from Ballroom dancing to Pointe. Now that I'm in high school, I don't have much time to dance because I am constantly busy with homework or studying, but whenever I have free time, I dance for hours nonstop to relieve myself from any stress and tension and enjoy life. Another hobbie of mine is working out. I have been working out since I was ten and I still do everyday. I love the way I feel after a really good run or bike ride and it also helps me a lot if I'm not having the best day. Another hobbie or activity is hanging out with my friends. I love being out with my friends, traveling with them, and being able to live an independent life with the people I trust the most. If I didn't dance, work out, hang out with my friends, and many other activities, I wouldn't be the person I am today. My hobbies make me who I am and they make me a better version of myself.</b></p>
